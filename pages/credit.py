A FICO score, from the Fair Isaac Corporation, is the most commonly used credit model. Your score is ranked from 300-800.

        1. **Payment History**: This is the most important factor. It shows whether you pay your bills on time.
        2. **Amounts Owed**: This looks at how much debt you have compared to your total available credit. It's not just about how much debt you have, but also how much of your available credit you're using. If you're using a lot of your available credit (like maxing out a credit card), it can lower your score.
        3. **Length of Credit History**: The longer your history of using credit responsibly, the better, the more reliable you seem to lenders.
        4. **New Credit**: Opening several new credit accounts in a short period of time can lower your score. Each time you apply for credit, a "hard inquiry" is made, and too many inquiries can indicate to lenders that you're trying to borrow more than you can handle.
        5. **Types of Credit Used**: Having a mix of different types of credit can benefit your score, as it shows you can manage different types of debt responsibly.

    st.markdown("### What kinds are there?")
    st.write("There are many different **types of credit cards** availables-- all with different benefits. These below are helpful starting points.")

    st.markdown("""
    1. **Student Credit Cards**
        - Specifically designed for people with little or no credit history, like college stdents. They often have lower credit limits and easier approval processes. These cards may offer rewards like cash back or points for purchases, such as dining or shopping. Using one responsibly (by paying on time) helps build your credit score and get you used to it. For example: The Discover itÂ® Student Cash Back card offers 5% cashback on rotating categories and 1% on other purchases, plus cashback matching in your first year.
    2. **Secured Credit Cards**
        - Requires you to put down a deposit, which serves as your credit limit. Itâ€™s a good option if youâ€™re new to credit or need to rebuild your score. The card functions like a regular credit card, and using it responsibly helps build your credit history. Many secured cards let you upgrade to an unsecured card over time. For example: The Capital One Secured MastercardÂ® lets you start with a deposit as low as $49 and offers a path to upgrade after responsible use
    3. **Travel Credit Cards**
        - For individuals who travel frequently for school, or work, they let you earn points or miles for purchases, which can be used to buy flights, hotel rooms, and other travel expenses. They typically require a bit more credit history, some entry-level travel cards have no annual fee and offer rewards on travel-related spending. For example: The Chase Sapphire PreferredÂ® Card offers 2x points on travel and dining, while a more basic card like the Capital One QuicksilverOne offers 1.5% cashback on all purchases, which can be used for travel expenses

When you carry a balance on your credit card from month to month (meaning you donâ€™t pay off the full amount), the credit card company charges interest on what you owe. This interest is often very highâ€”sometimes 20% or moreâ€”making it easy to fall deeper into debt.")

This means they will hire a collection agency to try to get you to pay what you owe. Collection agencies can be persistent, calling you repeatedly and even reporting your unpaid debt to the credit bureaus, which can damage your credit for years. Poor credit can make it harder to rent an apartment, buy a car, or even get a job.")
